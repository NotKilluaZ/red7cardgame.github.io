<h1>Red 7 Card Game</h1>
This program is a digital, text based card game that replicates the exisitng game, Red 7. You will be able to pick up to 3 bots to play against and can print the rules of the game within the game. The program is single player only. Good luck and have fun!

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
Once on Replit, and you are in this program, simply press the large green button at the top centre of the screen that reads "Run."

```The rules of Red 7 are simple! 
There are 4 components:
  - 49 cards, numbered 1 to 7 in seven colors
  - 4 icon/color reference guide cards
  - 2 turn option guide cards
  - 1 canvas (pile) card

Gameplay:
  The rule for winning at Red is straight forward: Have the best card! But will you still be playing the same game when your turn ends? If you're not winning by the current game's rule at the end of your turn, you're out, and the last person standing wins the round.
  The deck consists of 49 cards numbered 1-7, in each of the seven rainbow colors. A 7 is always higher than a 6, but a Red 6 is higher than an Orange 6, and so on down the color spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). When comparing two cards, compare value first, then color.
  
  
  To begin a game of Red7, deal out a seven-card hand to each player, and then deal one more card faceup in front of each player to start their Palette.
  Start the Canvas (discard pile) with the Red card. The top card of the Canvas pile determines what the rules are. The player with the lowest card on their Palette is currently the worst at Red, so that player will go first.

Game Turn:
  On your turn, you must take one of the following actions:
  Play a card faceup from your hand to your Palette.
  Discard a card from your hand to the Canvas to change the game to the rule of the discarded card's color. You must be winning the new game after you do this.
  Play a card from your hand to your Palette AND THEN discard a card to the Canvas. You must be winning the game after you do this.
  Do nothing, and lose. If your hand is empty, you must do this.
  If you are not winning the game at the end of your turn, you lose and are out of the round. If you are ever the last player in the game, you win the round!
  You are currently winning a game if your Palette contains more cards that meet the current game's rule than any other player. To break a tie, look at each tied player's highest card that follows the rule, checking its value, then its color if necessary.
  If you have no cards (for Green or Violet) that follow the rule, you are not winning. Examples are to the right for each rule. If you have no cards in your hand at the start of your turn, you lose since you are unable to do anything to win by the end of your turn.

End Game:
  Finally, if you do not have any cards left in your hand during your turn, you lose. If you are not winning at the end of your turn, you lose. If you do not play a card during your turn, you will lose. But, if you are the last player standing, you win!!! Best of luck...

Once you have started the card game, use the console to the right of this .md file to interact with the game. When the console asks for an input, enter your input inside of the console where the type cursor is set for you. The rules of the game are listed in the paragraph above. You are also able to print the same set of rules to the console before you begin when running the program.
